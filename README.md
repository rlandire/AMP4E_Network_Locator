# AMP4E_Network_Locator

Code to obtain the location in the network (wired or wireless) of users affected by threats (as detected in AMP4E dashboard)


## Business/Technical Challenge

**TODO:**
AMP4E dashboard allows security team to find out what devices are being affected by threats. In large organizations could be necessary to have the physical location of this device to take additional actions.



## Proposed Solution

**TODO:**
- Use the AMP4E APIs to get the information of a device compromised by a specific threat
- With the information obtained we can use the APIs of Prime Infrastructure, Connected Mobile Experience and Catalyt 9K switches to find out the location of the device.
- As front end we will use Google Home dialog
